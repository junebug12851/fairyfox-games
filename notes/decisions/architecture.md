# Architecture Decisions

Key structural choices and why. Newest on top.

### 2026-07-02 — Adopting hub 0.12.1: corrected to full adoption (v0.9.1)

Adopted the fairyfox standards 0.9.11 → 0.12.1 (see the v0.9.0/v0.9.1 changelog and
`fairyfox-reports/2026-07-02-adopting-updates.md`). **Correction:** the first pass (v0.9.0)
skipped two *mandatory* measures on my own judgment; the owner rightly rejected that, so
v0.9.1 adopts them. Recording the final state:

- **`.subnav` — ADOPTED (was wrongly skipped in 0.9.0).** The one-seamless-site model means
  the **primary** nav navigates the fairyfox.io homepage (you never "leave"); a subproject
  therefore **needs** its own secondary bar to navigate within itself. Added a `.subnav` with
  a **"Fairy Fox Games" sub-brand locator** + section links (Collection · Privacy · Terms ·
  Cookies · Source) on the landing and every legal page. This is *required* for a subproject,
  not optional — the earlier "single-section, omit it" call was wrong.
- **SLSA signed-releases — ADOPTED (was wrongly deferred as N/A in 0.9.0).** Added
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`: on a version tag it packages the static site into a zip,
  attests keyless SLSA build provenance, and publishes a GitHub Release. A static site *does*
  have a shippable artifact (the site bundle) to attest. The workflow reacts to the tag; it
  does not create it (hand-tagging stays).
- **Self-hosted fonts (beyond the standard).** The landing hot-linked Google Fonts (visitor
  IP → Google). Modelled on `random-ai-prompt`, we **vendored** Fraunces/Inter/JetBrains Mono
  as OFL variable woff2 under `assets/fonts/` (via Fontsource, `--no-save`, so the repo stays
  zero-dependency) and dropped the Google Fonts link. Now **zero third-party requests**.
- **Legal pages read as the subproject's.** Because the shared chrome makes everything look
  like one fairyfox.io site, the legal pages now wear the subnav locator + a "Fairy Fox Games
  · Legal" eyebrow and state in-copy that they cover *the games collection, not the wider
  site* — so scope is unmistakable.

**Lesson:** a "mandatory" hub measure is not mine to downgrade to "skip/N-A" on judgment.
When something seems inapplicable, adapt it to the project (as with signed-releases) or ask —
don't silently drop it.

### 2026-07-02 — Netlify retired; GitHub Pages is the sole host

**Reverses the 2026-06-29 dual-publish decision below.** Netlify has been discontinued
for this project (owner's call). `games.fairyfox.io` is gone. **GitHub Pages at
`fairyfox.io/fairyfox-games/` is now the single canonical home.** Removed:
`.github/workflows/netlify.yml`, `netlify.toml`, the Netlify badge, and all
`games.fairyfox.io` / Netlify references across the legal docs, README, SECURITY,
CLAUDE.md, status, and the issue template. Dated historical logs (session/version
entries) are left as-is — they accurately record what was true then. The legal docs
were updated in the same change (hosting section now names GitHub Pages only), keeping
the "Last updated" date current. (The shared hub-standard mirrors under
`notes/reference/` still describe the general "apps → Netlify" policy; that's a
system-level standard, not this project's config, and is out of scope here.)

### 2026-06-29 — Dual publish: GitHub Pages + Netlify (games.fairyfox.io) — SUPERSEDED (see above)

The site is published to **two** homes:

- **GitHub Pages** at `fairyfox.io/fairyfox-games/` — the docs-site standard's
  default (inherits the apex from the user site, no project CNAME). Unchanged.
- **Netlify** at **`games.fairyfox.io`** — a second, runnable home on the
  Netlify project `fairyfox-games` (site id `418513bf-…`), deployed from
  `.github/workflows/netlify.yml` via the Netlify CLI + a token.

**Why / tradeoff.** Owner's call: they want a Netlify-served copy on a dedicated
subdomain (the sibling `prompt.fairyfox.io` already does this, so the DNS pattern
is proven). This is a **deliberate divergence** from
`docs-site/10-domain-and-publishing.md`, which says project docs should live at
`fairyfox.io/<key>/` with *no* project subdomain. We keep the standard's Pages
URL too, so the divergence is *additive*, not a replacement — the canonical
docs URL in the registry stays `fairyfox.io/fairyfox-games/`. The Netlify custom
domain is set in Netlify (no repo `CNAME` file), so it doesn't collide with the
Pages apex.
