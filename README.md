# Fairy Fox Games

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/418513bf-eb19-4773-9283-b741091b337e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/fairyfox-games/deploys)

A growing collection of small, playable browser games — and an open experiment in
what an AI can dream up, build, and keep tending on its own. Every game here is
designed, coded, and looked after by AI, out in the open, purely for the fun of it.
New ones turn up often, and they're the kind you can start in a second and lose a few
happy minutes to.

It's an experiment, and the payoff is real games you can actually play. Some are
tiny, some are clever; all of them are here to be enjoyed.

**▶ Play them:** <https://games.fairyfox.io/> — or at
`https://fairyfox.io/fairyfox-games/<game>/`.

Part of the [Fairy Fox](https://fairyfox.io) project mesh, with the door open:
**contributions are welcome** — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). File an issue,
suggest a game, fix a bug, or send a whole new one.

## What's here

Each game lives in its own self-contained folder under [`games/`](games/) — its own
little world, with everything it needs and nothing reaching across to another game.
Open a game's folder and you'll find the game itself plus a short README on how it
works.

```

├── games/
│   └── ink-bloom/          # one folder per game (self-contained)

└── .github/                # CI, Pages deploy, issue + PR templates
```

## Run a game locally

The games are static — no build step. Serve the folder over HTTP (ES modules need a
server, not `file://`):

```sh
# from the repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/games/ink-bloom/
```

## Run the tests

Zero dependencies — just Node 18+ (built-in test runner):

```sh
npm test            # from the repo root: runs every game's *.test.js
# or per game:
cd games/ink-bloom && node --test
```

CI runs the full suite on every push and pull request.

## The games

| Game | What you do | Folder |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Ink Bloom** | Steer a growing line, eat motes, don't cross your own trail. | [`games/ink-bloom/`](games/ink-bloom/) |
| **Echo Chamber** | Catch the expanding echo as it crosses the target band; the window keeps tightening. | [`games/echo-chamber/`](games/echo-chamber/) |
| **Orbit Slingshot** | Hold to thrust your probe around a planet's gravity; sweep the targets, don't crash or escape. | [`games/orbit-slingshot/`](games/orbit-slingshot/) |
| **Polarity** | Flip your charge to match each incoming gate; clash and you're destroyed. It speeds up. | [`games/polarity/`](games/polarity/) |
| **Ricochet** | Aim and fire one shot that ricochets off the walls, sweeping up every target in its path. | [`games/ricochet/`](games/ricochet/) |
| **Skyline** | Drop a sliding slab onto your tower — the overhang is sliced off, so only precision keeps it climbing. | [`games/skyline/`](games/skyline/) |
| **Loft** | Keep the glowing orbs aloft — tap a falling orb to bat it up; you can only strike on the way down, and more orbs keep joining. | [`games/loft/`](games/loft/) |

_(A new one joins most days.)_

## Contributing

Yes please — see **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for how to add a game and the
few things it asks of one. Open an issue first if you want to talk it through, or just
send a PR. Bug reports and "I'd love a game that does X" ideas are equally welcome via
the [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/).
